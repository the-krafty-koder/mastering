🧠 Core Python Concepts
Variables and data types (int, str, list, dict, set, tuple)

Mutable vs immutable types

String formatting (f-strings, .format, %)

Slicing and list comprehensions

Functions (default args, \*args, \*\*kwargs)

Scope (LEGB rule), closures

Decorators and higher-order functions

Lambda functions

Iterators and generators (yield)

Context managers (with, **enter**, **exit**)

Type hinting and typing module

🧱 OOP in Python
Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism

Dunder methods (**init**, **str**, **repr**, etc.)

Class methods vs static methods vs instance methods

super() usage

@dataclass decorator

⏱ Asynchronous Programming
asyncio, async/await

Event loop and coroutines

Differences between threads, multiprocessing, and async IO

📦 Modules and Packaging
Creating and importing custom modules

**init**.py and Python packages

Virtual environments (venv, pipenv)

requirements.txt and dependency management

Installing packages (pip, poetry)

🧪 Testing and Debugging
unittest, pytest

Assertions

Mocking (unittest.mock)

Code coverage and test discovery

Debugging with pdb or VSCode/PyCharm tools

🗃 Data Structures & Algorithms
Lists, sets, dicts, tuples: time complexity and usage

Sorting and searching

Stacks, queues (with collections.deque)

Trees, graphs (if relevant)

Recursion and dynamic programming (commonly tested)

🔒 Security Basics
Handling user input safely

Avoiding code injection

Hashing passwords (bcrypt, hashlib)

Safe use of eval, exec (generally avoid!)

🌐 Web & APIs (if backend-focused)
Flask / FastAPI / Django basics

REST API design

Request handling, routing, middleware

ORM basics (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM)

Serializers and validation (e.g., Pydantic in FastAPI)

🧰 Popular Libraries & Tools
requests, httpx (HTTP clients)

pandas, numpy (data roles)

matplotlib, seaborn (plotting)

sqlalchemy, pymongo, redis clients

Celery for task queues

Click, argparse for CLIs

📂 File and OS Handling
Reading/writing files (open, with, readlines)

os, pathlib, shutil, glob

JSON and CSV handling

⚙️ Concurrency
Threading vs multiprocessing

GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) and how it affects concurrency

concurrent.futures

Queue usage in threaded/multiprocess apps
