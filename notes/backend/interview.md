3. Databases
   SQL (joins, indexing, transactions, isolation levels)

NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB, key-value, document, columnar stores)

ACID vs BASE

Query optimization and explain plans

ORMs and raw queries

4. APIs and Web
   HTTP/HTTPS basics

Status codes and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

6. DevOps and Infrastructure
   CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

Docker and containerization

Kubernetes basics

Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)

Monitoring and logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)

Infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible)

7. Testing
   Unit testing (e.g., pytest, JUnit)

Integration testing

Test-driven development (TDD)

Mocking and stubbing

Load and performance testing

8. Language-Specific Topics
   Make sure you're solid in your backend language of choice. For example:

Python: async/await, generators, context managers

JavaScript/Node.js: event loop, async patterns

Java: concurrency, Spring ecosystem

Go: goroutines, channels, interfaces

9. Behavioral and Culture Fit
   Past project experience

Trade-offs you’ve made

Debugging tough issues

Communication and collaboration in teams
