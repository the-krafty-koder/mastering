# K nearest neighbor

- Used for classification (categorizing a group) and regression ( predicting a response).
- Involves determining a nodes type by looking at its neighbors. Distance between that nodes and others around it is calculated using vectors i.e (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) and the pythagorean formula. It is deemed to be of the same type as nodes closest to it.
