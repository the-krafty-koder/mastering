# Greedy algorithms

The classroom scheduling problem.

- Suppose you have a couple of lessons that overlap each other eg art (9.00 - 10.00), art (9.30-10.30), math (10.00-11.00), etc how do you find the maximum number of classes you can hold?

1. Pick the class that ends the soonest. This is the first class youll hold.
2. Pick a class that starts after the 1st class, one that ends the soonest.
3. Repeat until the end.

# Approximation algorithms

- Used when calculating the exact solution will take too much time.
