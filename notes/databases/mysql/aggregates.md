# Group By

Used to group records in a result set by a distinct column

# Aggregate functions

Aggregate functions perform a specific operation over all rows in a group.
max() - return max values within a set
min() - return mi values within a set
avg() - returns average value within a set
sum() - returns the sum of values within a set
count() - returns number of values in a set

# Counting Distinct Values

`mysql> SELECT COUNT(customer_id) num_rows, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) distinct_rows FROM payment;`

# Handling null values

Null values are ignored when aggregate functions are executed.

# Generating groups

Group by function is used for this.

# Grouping via expressions

Along with using columns to group data, you can build groups based on the values
generated by expressions. Consider the following query, which groups rentals by year:
mysql> SELECT extract(YEAR FROM rental_date) year,
-> COUNT(\*) how_many
-> FROM rental
-> GROUP BY extract(YEAR FROM rental_date);

SELECT fa.actor_id, f.rating
FROM film_actor fa
INNER JOIN film f
ON fa.film_id = f.film_id
GROUP BY fa.actor_id
